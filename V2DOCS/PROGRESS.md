## Design System

### Typography
- **Primary Font:** DM Sans (via Google Fonts)
- **Monospace Font:** DM Mono

### Color Palette

**Light Mode:**
- Background: White (#FFFFFF)
- Card Background: White (#FFFFFF)
- Border: Light gray (#E5E7EB)
- Text Primary: Slate 800 (#1E293B)
- Text Secondary: Slate 500 (#64748B)

**Dark Mode:**
- Background: Dark gray (#1A1A1A)
- Card Background: Slightly lighter (#242424)
- Border: Medium gray (#3D3D3D)
- Text Primary: Light gray (#EBEBEB)

- **Brand Colors Preserved:**
  - Brand Navy: #0D2B55
  - Brand Blue: #1A5EA8
  - Brand Teal: #00C2A8

### Features

- **Full Dark Mode Support** - Light, Dark, and System modes
- **Auth Pages** - Background image with gradient overlay
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints

### Dark Mode Implementation

All components use semantic Tailwind tokens for proper dark mode support:

| Token | Light Mode | Dark Mode | Usage |
|-------|------------|-----------|-------|
| `bg-background` | oklch(1 0 0) | #1a1a1a | Page backgrounds |
| `bg-card` | oklch(1 0 0) | #242424 | Card backgrounds |
| `text-foreground` | oklch(0.145 0 0) | oklch(0.92 0 0) | Primary text |
| `text-muted-foreground` | oklch(0.556 0 0) | oklch(0.65 0 0) | Secondary text |
| `border-input` | oklch(0.922 0 0) | #3d3d3d | Input borders |
| `border-border` | oklch(0.922 0 0) | #3d3d3d | General borders |
| `bg-muted` | oklch(0.97 0 0) | #2d2d2d | Muted backgrounds |
| `bg-destructive` | oklch(0.577...) | oklch(0.577...) | Error/destructive |

**Rule:** Never use hardcoded colors like `bg-white`, `text-slate-500`, `border-slate-300`. Always use semantic tokens.

---

## Known Issues & Fixes Applied

### Signature Upload RLS Issue
- **Problem:** "new row violates row-level security policy" when uploading signature during onboarding
- **Root Cause:** Storage policies checked for folder path but signatures were stored as flat paths
- **Solution:** Updated storage policies in `014_storage.sql` to handle both folder-based and flat paths using `split_part()`

---

## Future Phases (Not Started)

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Phase 10 | Reports & Audit Log |
| Phase 11 | Settings & Admin |
| Phase 12 | Messaging System |
| Phase 13 | (Reserved for future expansion) |
